## Background

Understanding cellular differentiation and transitions is crucial in developmental biology and regenerative medicine. Hopfield networks provide a framework for modeling these processes by representing gene expression states as memory patterns and computing energy landscapes that describe transitions between cell states.

The `HopfieldModel` package facilitates these analyses with tools to normalize gene expression data, select highly variable genes, compute cell-specific Hopfield energy, and visualize cellular transitions. The package is intended for researchers and students working with single-cell RNA sequencing data, offering a streamlined and accessible approach to study cell states and transitions.
